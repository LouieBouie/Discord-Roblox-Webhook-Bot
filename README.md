# What is this?
**This is a bot where you can receive from Roblox servers and send them to a channel. This uses webhooks to receive data from Roblox servers. You can use this for your serverside or anything else
you'd like.**

# Instructions
**1. Configurate the values in the config.json file in the JavaScript folder. Replace logChannelID with the channel ID that you want to send the embedded data to.**

**2. Configurate the webhookURL variable in the script.lua file in the Lua folder and replace it with your Discord webhook URL.**

**3. Start the Discord bot with `node index.js` in the JavaScript folder.**

**4. Place the script.lua script in your Roblox game and you're done!**

Have fun using this and don't break Discord's rate-limiting.
